/* "Oh no! Santa's elves have made a mess of the Naughty List and the names have all been mixed with the Nice List. 
Fortunately, the elves separate the naughty from the nice with the use of lowercase letters.
You will be given a string containing a mix of both upper and lowercase letters.
You will need to write a function to separate the lowercase letters to find out the name of the person on the Naughty List.

 - The name will be spread out among the letters but will remain in the right order.
