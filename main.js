/* "Oh no! Santa's elves have made a mess of the Nice List and the names have all been mixed with the Naughty List. 
Fortunately, the elves separate the naughty kids using UPPERCASE letters.
You will be given a string containing a mix of both upper and lowercase letters.
You will need to write a function to separate the lowercase letters to find out the name of the person on the Nice List.

 - The name will be spread out among the letters but will remain in the right order.


For example : KDFbJLASKJuDFNLJKCNMPEWdOIFPQWOIKCMLASKDCdNALSDyJKFN = buddy
